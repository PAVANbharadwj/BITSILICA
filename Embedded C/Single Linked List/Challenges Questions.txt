------------
These advanced linked list problems are designed to test and strengthen your understanding of single linked lists, especially for technical interviews. Each question includes sample input and the expected output.

1.Detect a Loop
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 (node 5 points back to node 2)
Expected Output: Loop detected. Starting node of loop is 2

2.Reverse in Groups of K
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6, k = 2
Expected Output: 2 → 1 → 4 → 3 → 6 → 5

3.Find Intersection Point
Input: List1: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5, List2: 9 → 4 → 5 (nodes 4 and 5 are shared)
Expected Output: Intersection at node with value 4

4.Check for Palindrome
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 1
Expected Output: True (The list is a palindrome)

5.Remove N-th Node from End
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5, n = 2
Expected Output: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5

6.Merge Two Sorted Lists
Input: List1: 1 → 3 → 5, List2: 2 → 4 → 6
Expected Output: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6

7.Add Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists
Input: List1: 2 → 4 → 3 (342), List2: 5 → 6 → 4 (465)
Expected Output: 7 → 0 → 8 (807)

8.Clone a List with Random Pointers
Input: A (rand→C) → B (rand→A) → C (rand→B)
Expected Output: New cloned list where each node’s random pointer is correctly set

9.Find the Middle Node
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
Expected Output: 3

10.Remove Duplicates (Unsorted List)
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 4
Expected Output: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4

11.Segregate Even and Odd Nodes
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6
Expected Output: 2 → 4 → 6 → 1 → 3 → 5

12.Rotate Linked List
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5, k = 2
Expected Output: 4 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 3

13.Flatten a Multilevel Linked List
Input: 1 → 2 → 3, node 2’s child: 7 → 8, node 8’s child: 11
Expected Output: 1 → 2 → 7 → 8 → 11 → 3

14.Sort a Linked List
Input: 3 → 1 → 5 → 2 → 4
Expected Output: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

15.Pairwise Swap Nodes
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
Expected Output: 2 → 1 → 4 → 3 → 5

16.Detect and Remove Loop
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 2 (loop at node 2)
Expected Output: Loop removed. New list: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4

17.Find Intersection with Arbitrary Lengths
Input: List1: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5, List2: 9 → 8 → 5 (node 5 shared)
Expected Output: Intersection at node with value 5

18.Move Last Element to Front
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
Expected Output: 5 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4

19.Find the Length of a Loop
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 2 (loop includes nodes 2, 3, 4)
Expected Output: Loop length is 3

20.Reverse Alternate K Nodes
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8, k = 2
