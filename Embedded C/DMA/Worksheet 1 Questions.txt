Worksheet 1
Focus: C programming using malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free()

Objective: Build confidence and expertise through guided practice

Exercise 1: Allocate Memory for an Integer
Goal: Understand how to allocate memory for a single variable using malloc.

Activity:

Log Session a pointer to an integer.
Use malloc to allocate memory for one integer.
Assign a value to that memory.
Print the value through the pointer.
Free the allocated memory.
Include NULL check after malloc.

Exercise 2: Allocate and Store a List of Integers
Goal: Practice allocating memory for an array of integers.

Activity:

Ask the user to enter the number of integers.
Allocate memory dynamically using malloc based on input.
Use a loop to take integer inputs into the allocated array.
Display the entered values.
Free the allocated memory.

Exercise 3: Zero-Initialize an Integer Array
Goal: Understand how calloc initializes memory.

Activity:

Ask the user for the number of elements.
Allocate memory using calloc.
Print the initial values (before user input).
Assign values, then display them.
Free the memory after use.

Exercise 4: Compare malloc and calloc
Goal: Learn the key difference between malloc and calloc.

Activity:

Allocate two arrays using malloc and calloc with the same size.
Print the default values in both arrays.
Use a loop for printing to understand initialization differences.
Free both arrays.

Exercise 5: Reallocate an Array Dynamically
Goal: Use realloc to extend an array as needed.

Activity:

Allocate memory for 2 integers.
Ask the user for values.
Then resize the array to 5 integers using realloc.
Accept more values into the resized array.
Print all values.
Free the memory at the end.

Exercise 6: Log Session a Dynamic 2D Array
Goal: Learn how to allocate and access a 2D array dynamically.

Activity:

Ask the user for number of rows and columns.
Allocate memory for an array of row pointers.
Allocate each row separately using malloc.
Accept values for each row-column index.
Display the matrix.
Free each row and then the row pointer array.

Exercise 7: Dynamic String Input
Goal: Handle strings with dynamic memory allocation.

Activity:

Ask the user to enter a string.
Find its length using strlen.
Allocate memory to store the string using malloc.
Copy the string to the new memory.
Print the copied string.
Free the memory.

Exercise 8: Implement Custom strdup()
Goal: Practice duplicating a string using dynamic memory.

Activity:

Log Session a function that takes a string as input.
Allocate memory for a copy of the string.
Copy character by character.
Return the copied string.
Call this function and display the result.
Free the copied string.

Exercise 9: Log Session a Linked List with 3 Nodes
Goal: Apply dynamic memory to build a simple linked list.

Activity:

Define a struct for a node with data and next.
Use malloc to create 3 nodes dynamically.
Link the nodes manually.
Traverse and print the list.
Free all nodes after traversal.

Exercise 10: Log Session and Reverse an Array
Goal: Use pointers to reverse dynamically allocated memory.

Activity:

Allocate an array of integers using malloc.
Accept n values.
Reverse the array using pointer arithmetic (not indexing).
Print reversed values.
Free the memory.

Exercise 11: Accept Characters Until Enter Pressed
Goal: Dynamically grow a string buffer with realloc.

Activity:

Start with a small buffer.
Accept characters one by one.
Reallocate buffer each time a new character is added.
Stop on newline character.
Null-terminate and print the string.
Free the memory.

Exercise 12: Track Frequency of Elements
Goal: Use calloc for zero-initialized counting.

Activity:

Allocate an integer array of size 100 using calloc.
Accept n numbers between 0 and 99.
Increment the value at each index to count frequency.
Display the frequencies.
Free the memory.

Exercise 13: Memory Leak Simulation
Goal: Understand what a memory leak is.

Activity:

Allocate memory using malloc and assign values.
Intentionally skip free().
Run the program with tools like valgrind to observe the leak.
Fix the leak by adding proper free().

Exercise 14: Tokenize String Dynamically
Goal: Store each word of a sentence in dynamically allocated memory.

Activity:

Accept a sentence as input.
Use strtok() to split it into words.
Use malloc to copy each token into a new memory block.
Store them in a pointer array.
Print all words and free each block.

Exercise 15: Dynamic Menu-Driven Array
Goal: Handle operations on a dynamic array with growing size.

Activity:

Start with an empty array.
Provide a menu with options: Add element, Display, Exit.
Use realloc each time user adds an element.
Print array contents.
Free memory on exit.

Exercise 16: Safe Memory Allocation Check
Goal: Practice error-checking after allocation.

Activity:

Try allocating a large chunk of memory (e.g., 1GB).
Check if the pointer is NULL.
If successful, print a success message.
If failed, handle the error gracefully.
Free if allocation succeeded.

Exercise 17: Struct Array with Dynamic Allocation
Goal: Allocate memory for array of structs.

Activity:

Define a struct (e.g., name and age).
Ask user how many entries to store.
Allocate memory using malloc.
Accept values and display them.
Free the memory.

Exercise 18: Insert Element at Any Position
Goal: Modify dynamic array and shift elements.

Activity:

Allocate memory for an array.
Accept n values.
Ask user to insert a value at a specific position.
Use realloc to increase size.
Shift elements and insert new value.
Print final array and free memory.

Exercise 19: Dynamic Array of Pointers to Integers
Goal: Work with array of pointers using malloc.

Activity:

Ask user for count.
Allocate array of int* pointers.
Use malloc to assign an integer for each pointer.
Assign and print values.
Free all integers and the array.

Exercise 20: Simulate Memory Fragmentation
Goal: Understand fragmentation with sequential malloc and free.

Activity:

Allocate multiple memory blocks of varying sizes.
Free some in between.
Allocate a new block that fits only in fragmented space.
Observe behavior.
Free all at the end.
