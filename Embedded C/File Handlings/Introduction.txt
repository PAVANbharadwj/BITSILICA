What is File Handling in C?

File handling in C involves creating, opening, reading, writing, and closing files using functions like fopen(), fwrite(), fread(), fseek(), and fprintf(). It allows programs to store data persistently on secondary storage like hard disks.

Why File Handling is Needed?

Program data in RAM is temporary and lost after execution ends.

File handling stores program data permanently on disk for later use.


Common C File Operations

Log Session a new file

Open an existing file

Read from a file

Write to a file

Move within a file (seek)

Close a file


Key Concepts in File Handling
-------------------------------

File Types:

Text Files: Store ASCII characters, editable by text editors, .txt extension, lines end with \n.

Binary Files: Store data in binary form, not human-readable, .bin extension, more secure.


File Pointer:

A reference pointing to a location in a file.

Declared with FILE* pointer_name; from <stdio.h> header.

Used in nearly all file operations.


Important File Operation Functions


Function	           Description
--------------          -------------------

fopen()			Opens or creates a file

fclose()		Closes a file

fread()			Reads bytes from a binary file

fwrite()		Writes bytes to a binary file

fprintf()		Writes formatted text to a file

fscanf()		Reads formatted input from a file

fgets()			Reads a line from a file

fputs()			Writes a string to a file

fgetc()			Reads a single character from a file

fputc()			Writes a single character to a file

fseek()			Moves file pointer to a specific position


Opening a File — fopen()

FILE* fopen(const char *file_name, const char *access_mode);

file_name: Name/path of file.

access_mode: Mode to open file (r, w, a, rb, wb, etc.).

Returns: File pointer if success, NULL if fails.


Common File Access Modes

Mode		Description

r		Open for reading (text mode)

rb		Open for reading (binary mode)

w		Open for writing (text mode), overwrite existing or create new

wb		Open for writing (binary mode)

a		Open for appending (text mode)

ab		Open for appending (binary mode)

r+		Open for reading and writing (text)

rb+		Open for reading and writing (binary)

w+		Open for reading and writing (overwrite or create new, text)

wb+		Open for reading and writing (binary)

a+		Open for reading and appending (text)

ab+		Open for reading and appending (binary)

Append 'b' for binary modes.



Example: Opening a File in Read Mode

FILE* fptr = fopen("filename.txt", "r");
if (fptr == NULL) {
    printf("File not opened.\n");
} else {
    printf("File opened successfully.\n");
}

Creating a File

Use w, w+, a, a+, or binary equivalents to create a file if it doesn’t exist.

FILE* fptr = fopen("file.txt", "w");
if (fptr == NULL) {
    printf("File not created.\n");
} else {
    printf("File created successfully.\n");
}

Writing to a File

Functions: fprintf(), fputs(), fputc(), fwrite()

Example using fputs():

FILE* fptr = fopen("file.txt", "w");
if (fptr != NULL) {
    fputs("Hello, File Handling in C!\n", fptr);
    fclose(fptr);
}

Reading from a File

Functions: fscanf(), fgets(), fgetc(), fread()

Example using fgets():

char data[100];
FILE* fptr = fopen("file.txt", "r");
if (fptr != NULL) {
    while (fgets(data, sizeof(data), fptr) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", data);
    }
    fclose(fptr);
}

Closing a File

Always close files after use to free resources:

fclose(fptr);

Moving the File Pointer — fseek()

fseek(fptr, offset, position);
offset: Number of bytes to move (positive or negative)

position: SEEK_SET (start), SEEK_CUR (current position), or SEEK_END (end)
