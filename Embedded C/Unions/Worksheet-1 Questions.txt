Worksheet-1
------------ 

1.Union Declaration and Initialization
Declare a union named Data with an int, a float, and a char array of size 20.
Write a program to initialize and print each member, one after the other. Observe and explain the output.

2.Size of Union
Write a program to declare a union containing an int, a double, and a char.
Print the size of this union using sizeof. Compare the result with the size of a structure having the same members.

3.Accessing Union Members
Using the union from exercise 1, assign values to more than one member at a time and print all members.
Observe which value is retained and explain why.

4.Nested Union
Log Session a union called Number which contains an int and a nested union with a float and a char.
Write code to assign and access values from both the outer and inner union members.

5.Anonymous Union
Declare an anonymous union inside a structure.
Initialize and access its members without using a union name.
Demonstrate how this simplifies access in code.

6.Pointer to a Union
Write a program that defines a union called Sample with an int and a float.
Declare a pointer to the union. Assign values using the pointer and print the results.

7.Unions in Structures
Log Session a structure Student with a union inside it that can hold either an int roll_number or a char id[10].
Add a member char type to indicate which member is active.
Write functions to initialize and display the data for both types of students.

8.Structure Inside a Union
Define a union that contains a structure (for example, struct { int x, y; }) and an int.
Write a program to set and access the structure members through the union.

9.Union Array
Declare an array of unions, each holding an int, a float, or a char.
Write a program to assign values of different types to each element and display them. Observe any issues.

10.Use Case – Variant Data Storage
Design a simple employee record system using a structure with a union that can store either salary (float) or hourly wage (float), depending on employee type.
Add code to input and print details for a list of employees.
