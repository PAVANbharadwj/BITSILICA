Challenges
1. Find the subarray with the maximum sum (Kadane’s Algorithm)
Implement an efficient algorithm to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum.

Example: Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Output: 6 (subarray: [4, -1, 2, 1])

2. Rearrange array elements so that positive and negative numbers are placed alternatively
Without changing the relative order of positive and negative numbers, rearrange them alternately. Extra space should be avoided if possible.

Example: Input: [1, 2, -3, -1, -2, 3]
Output: [1, -3, 2, -1, 3, -2]

3. Find the duplicate number in an array of n+1 integers (each from 1 to n)
Use Floyd’s Cycle Detection or other space-efficient methods to detect a repeated number in the array without modifying the input.

Example: Input: [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]
Output: 3

4. Rotate an array by 'k' positions to the right
Efficiently rotate an array of size n by k steps. Implement both brute force and optimized solutions (like reversal algorithm).

Example: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 3
Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

5. Find the intersection of two unsorted arrays
Return common elements between two arrays without using additional space, or use a hash-set for optimized solution.

Example: Input: A = [1, 2, 4, 5], B = [2, 3, 5, 7]
Output: [2, 5]

6. Find the first missing positive integer in an unsorted array
Write an efficient algorithm to find the smallest missing positive integer from an unsorted array (in O(n) time and constant space).

Example: Input: [3, 4, -1, 1]
Output: 2

7. Merge two sorted arrays without using extra space
Merge two sorted arrays A[] and B[] such that A contains the first n elements and B the rest, and after merging both are still sorted.

Example: Input: A = [1, 3, 5], B = [2, 4, 6]
Output: A = [1, 2, 3], B = [4, 5, 6]

8. Find the majority element (element that appears more than n/2 times)
Use Moore’s Voting Algorithm to identify the majority element if it exists.

Example: Input: [2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
Output: 2

9. Find the longest subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s
Transform the problem using 0 → -1 and use hashmap to find the longest subarray with zero sum.

Example: Input: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: Length = 6

10. Find all pairs in the array whose sum is equal to a given number
Given an array and a number, find all pairs whose sum equals the given number. Optimize for time complexity using hash map.
