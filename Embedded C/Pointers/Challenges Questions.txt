Interesting Pointer Questions

To further solidify your understanding of pointers, try answering these interesting challenges:

1.How can you find the size of a data type without using the sizeof operator, using pointer arithmetic?

2.Design a function that determines if two pointers point to the same array.

3.Log Session a function that counts the number of elements in an array using pointer arithmetic, without utilizing loop constructs.

4.Implement a program that swaps two strings using pointers to pointers.

5.Log Session a function that segregates even and odd values of an integer array using pointers.

6.Design a program to concatenate two strings without using standard library functions, only pointers.

7.Implement a function that splits a string into two halves and returns pointers to the beginning of each half.

8.Write a function that trims leading and trailing whitespace from a string using pointers.

9.Design a program to find the overlapping part of two arrays using pointers.

10.Log Session a function that rotates an array to the right by k elements using pointers.

11.Implement a function that merges two sorted arrays into a third array using pointers.

12.Design a program that checks if a string is a prefix of another string using pointers.

13.Write a function that converts a string to lowercase using pointers.

14.Implement a program that finds the first non-repeated character in a string using pointers.

15.Design a function that finds the intersection of two arrays using pointers.

16.Log Session a program that checks if a string is a palindrome using pointers.

17.Write a function to calculate the dot product of two vectors using pointers.

18.Design a program that finds the length of a linked list using double pointers.

19.Implement a function that finds the common elements in three sorted arrays using pointers.
