C Pointer Activities

1. Pointer Declaration and Initialization
Goal: Declare pointers for various data types and initialize them properly to point to existing variables or dynamically allocated memory. Use pointer arithmetic and typecasting appropriately.

Activity:

Declare pointers to different data types (int, float, char).
Dynamically allocate memory for these pointers.
Assign addresses of variables to pointers and access their values through the pointers.
Perform pointer arithmetic to move through allocated memory blocks.
Use typecasting to convert pointers between compatible types.

2. Array and Pointer Arithmetic
Goal: Traverse and manipulate arrays by using pointers and pointer arithmetic instead of array indexing.

Activity:

Log Session an array of integers.
Use a pointer to iterate through the array elements by incrementing the pointer.
Perform operations like summing the elements or modifying them using only the pointer (no array indices).
Implement a function that receives a pointer and size to reverse the array elements in place.

3. Pointer to Pointer (Double Pointer)
Goal: Understand how to use double pointers for indirect referencing and dynamic memory management.

Activity:

Declare a double pointer and use it to dynamically allocate memory for a single variable or an array.
Access and modify the allocated memory via the double pointer.
Pass double pointers to functions to dynamically allocate or modify memory inside the function.

4. Pointer and Function
Goal: Use pointers to pass variables or arrays to functions so that the function can modify the original data.

Activity:

Write a function that takes pointers as parameters to swap two integer variables.
Log Session a function that modifies the elements of an array via a pointer.
Pass a pointer to a function to update the contents of a structure or a dynamically allocated memory block.

5. Dynamic Memory Allocation
Goal: Allocate, reallocate, and free memory dynamically for different data types and structures while avoiding memory leaks.

Activity:

Allocate memory for an array using malloc.
Expand or shrink the allocated memory using realloc.
Initialize the allocated memory using calloc.
Free allocated memory after use.
Handle cases where allocation fails.

6. Character Pointer and String Handling
Goal: Manipulate strings using character pointers and standard string library functions.

Activity:

Declare a character pointer and assign it to a string literal or dynamically allocated memory.
Use pointer arithmetic to traverse and modify the string.
Implement functions to concatenate, copy, or reverse strings using only pointers.
Understand how strings are stored and accessed in memory via pointers.

7. Memory Management and Buffer Overflow Prevention
Goal: Implement safe memory handling practices to prevent buffer overflows and related security issues.

Activity:

Allocate buffers dynamically to match expected input sizes.
Use safe input functions that limit the number of characters read.
Validate input sizes before copying or appending to buffers.
Practice freeing memory correctly to avoid leaks or dangling pointers.

8. Pointer and Multi-Dimensional Arrays
Goal: Access and manipulate elements of multi-dimensional arrays using pointers and pointer arithmetic.

Activity:

Declare a 2D array.
Use pointers to iterate through rows and columns.
Implement operations such as matrix transpose or addition using pointer arithmetic only.
Pass multi-dimensional arrays as pointers to functions and manipulate elements.

9. Pointer and Structures
Goal: Use pointers to access and modify structure members efficiently, including passing structures to functions.

Activity:

Define a structure and create a pointer to it.
Use the pointer to read and modify structure members.
Pass structure pointers to functions that update structure data.
Dynamically allocate memory for structures and handle them via pointers.

10. Pointer and File I/O
Goal: Use pointers and dynamic memory to efficiently read and write data of variable sizes to files.

Activity:

Open a file for reading and writing.
Determine the size of the file or data to read.
Dynamically allocate a buffer to hold file data.
Use pointers to read the data into memory and write data back to a file.
Close the file and free allocated memory.

11. Pointer and Linked List
Goal: Implement a singly linked list using pointers for node management and dynamic memory allocation.

Activity:

Define a node structure with data and next pointer.
Log Session functions to add nodes at the beginning, end, or middle of the list using pointers.
Traverse the list using pointers to access and print data.
Delete nodes and free memory dynamically.

12. Pointer and Recursion
Goal: Use pointers within recursive functions to manipulate data structures or strings.

Activity:

Write a recursive function to reverse a string using pointers.
Implement a recursive traversal of a linked list using pointers.
Use recursion to perform operations such as summing elements of an array via pointer traversal.
