Challenges
1. Reverse a string in-place without using extra memory
Explain your approach to reversing a string by swapping characters from the start and end moving towards the center, without using extra storage.

Example: Input: "interview"
Output: "weivretni"

2. Find the first non-repeating character in a given string
Identify the first character that does not repeat anywhere else in the string, optimizing for time and space complexity.

Example: Input: "swiss"
Output: 'w'

3. Check if two strings are anagrams without using built-in sort
Determine if two strings contain the exact same characters in any order, without sorting them.

Example: Input: "listen", "silent"
Output: true

4. Remove duplicate characters from a string while preserving order
Write a function to remove repeated characters, keeping the original sequence of the first occurrence.

Example: Input: "embedded"
Output: "embed"

5. Find the longest substring without repeating characters
Find the length or substring which has all unique characters without any repetition.

Example: Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: "abc"

6. Implement pattern matching using the KMP algorithm
Explain and implement the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for substring search, focusing on preprocessing the pattern to avoid redundant comparisons.

Example: Pattern: "abc"
Text: "ababcabcab"
Output: Pattern found at indices 2, 5

7. Check if one string is a rotation of another
Verify if one string can be obtained by rotating another string. Use string concatenation and substring search.

Example: Input: "abcd", "cdab"
Output: true

8. Find the lexicographic rank of a string (with duplicates)
Calculate the position of the string in the sorted list of all its permutations.

Example: Input: "string"
Output: 598

9. Implement Run-Length Encoding (RLE) for string compression
Compress a string by replacing consecutive repeated characters with the character followed by the count.

Example: Input: "aaabbc"
Output: "a3b2c1"

10. Print all permutations of a string in lexicographic order
Generate and print every permutation of the given string sorted alphabetically.
 
Example: Input: "abc"
Output: "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"
