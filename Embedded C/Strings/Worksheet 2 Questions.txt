Worksheet 2
 
1)Swap the contents of two strings without using any extra temporary string variables. The strings' values should be exchanged completely.
Input: str1 = "hello", str2 = "world"
Output: str1 = "world", str2 = "hello"
2)Sort an array of strings in alphabetical order. The sorted array should list strings from A to Z.
Input: {"John", "Alice", "Bob"}
Output: {"Alice", "Bob", "John"}
3)Check whether a given string is a palindrome, i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards.
Input: "madam"
Output: Palindrome
4)Find the character that appears most frequently in the input string and print it.
Input: "sample string"
Output: 's'
5)Remove all duplicate characters from a string, keeping only the first occurrence of each character.
Input: "programming"
Output: "progamin"
6)Print all characters that occur more than once in a string.
Input: "programming"
Output: r g m
7)Remove from the first string all characters that appear in the second string.
Input: str1 = "hello world", str2 = "low"
Output: "he rd"
8)Check if one string is a rotation of another, i.e., one string can be shifted to get the other.
Input: "abcd", "cdab"
Output: Yes
9)Print the reverse of a string using recursion.
Input: "hello"
Output: "olleh"
10)Print all permutations of a given string. All possible arrangements of characters should be printed.
Input: "ABC"
Output: "ABC", "ACB", "BAC", "BCA", "CAB", "CBA"
11)Divide a string into N equal parts and print each part separately.
Input: "abcdefgh", N=4
Output: "ab", "cd", "ef", "gh"
12)Find the first non-repeating character in a string and print it.
Input: "swiss"
Output: 'w'
13)Given a list of strings and a word, print the strings containing all characters of that word.
Input: Word = "act", List = ["cat", "tac", "act", "dog"]
Output: "cat", "tac", "act"
14)Reverse the order of words in a sentence without reversing the words themselves.
Input: "Hello world"
Output: "world Hello"
15)Compress a string using run-length encoding by replacing repeated characters with the character and count.
Input: "aaabbcc"
Output: "a3b2c2"
16)Find the smallest substring in a string containing all characters of another string.
Input: str1 = "this is a test string", str2 = "tist"
Output: "t stri"
17)Implement naive pattern searching to find all occurrences of a pattern in a text.
Input: Text = "hello world", Pattern = "lo"
Output: Pattern found at index 3
18)Implement Rabin-Karp algorithm using hashing to find patterns in a text efficiently.
Input: Text = "abcxabcdabcdabcy", Pattern = "abcdabcy"
Output: Pattern found at index 8
19)Find the length of the longest substring with no repeating characters.
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
20)Print all possible interleavings of two strings, preserving the relative order of characters in each string.
Input: str1 = "AB", str2 = "CD"
Output: "ABCD", "ACBD", "ACDB", "CABD", "CADB", "CDAB"
21)Check if a string is an interleaving of two other strings, i.e., formed by merging them maintaining order.
Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "def", s3 = "adbcef"
Output: True
22)Check if two strings are anagrams of each other by comparing character counts.
Input: "listen", "silent"
Output: True
23)Implement Boyer-Moore pattern searching algorithm with bad character heuristic to search a pattern in a text.
Input: Text = "here is a simple example", Pattern = "example"
Output: Pattern found at index 17
24)Partition a string into the minimum number of palindromic substrings (Palindrome Partitioning).
Input: "ababbbabbababa"
Output: 3
25)Find the longest palindromic substring inside a given string.
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab" or "aba"
26)Group a list of words so that anagrams are together.
Input: ["cat", "tac", "act", "dog"]
Output: ["cat", "tac", "act"], ["dog"]
27)Count the number of words in a string separated by spaces.
Input: "Hello world"
Output: 2
28)Match a string against a pattern containing wildcards '*' (any sequence) and '?' (single character).
Input: Pattern = "g*ks", String = "geeks"
Output: Match
29)Convert a numeric string to an integer without using built-in functions.
Input: "1234"
Output: 1234
30)Find the longest substring common to two given strings.
Input: "abcdxyz", "xyzabcd"
Output: "abcd"
31)Remove all occurrences of character 'b' and substring "ac" from a string.
Input: "abacb"
Output: "a"
32)Use dynamic programming to check if a string is an interleaving of two other strings.
Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "def", s3 = "adbcef"
Output: True
33)For a stream of characters, print the first non-repeating character at each step.
Input stream: "aabc"
Output: "a a b b"
34)Recursively remove all adjacent duplicate characters from a string until no duplicates remain.
Input: "azxxzy"
Output: "ay"
35)Rearrange characters in a string so that the same characters are at least d distance apart.
Input: "aabbcc", d=2
Output: "abcabc"
36)Find the character with the second highest frequency in a string.
Input: "aabababa"
