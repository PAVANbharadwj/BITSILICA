Challenges
-----------------

1.Given an array where every element appears exactly three times except one element that appears only once, find that unique element.

2.In an array where all numbers appear twice except two numbers that appear once, identify those two unique numbers.

3.Calculate the total count of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of all numbers from 1 up to a given number n.

4.Determine whether a given integer is a power of two using efficient bitwise operations.

5.For a number that has exactly one set bit (i.e., is a power of two), find the position/index of that set bit.

6.Given an array where every element appears twice except two elements appearing once, find those two unique elements using XOR operations.

7.Given two integers, calculate how many bits differ between them (i.e., bits that need flipping to convert one number into the other).

8.Compute the XOR of all integers in the range from 1 up to n without iterating over the entire range.

9.Given an array, find the XOR of all elements excluding a particular specified element.

10.Given a number and two bit positions, swap the bits at those positions using bitwise operations.

11.Find the XOR of all numbers between L and R (inclusive) without iterating through each number.

12.Efficiently calculate the minimum number of bit flips required to convert integer A into integer B.

13.In an array where all numbers occur an even number of times except two numbers that occur an odd number of times, find those two numbers.

14.Given a number, find the next smallest number larger than it that has the same count of set bits.

15.Given a number, find the immediate next greater number that has the same number of 1s in its binary representation.

16.Determine whether a given number is a power of four efficiently.

17.In an array where every element appears twice except one, find that single unique number.

18.Given a number N, find the greatest power of two that is less than or equal to N.

19.A number is called sparse if there are no two adjacent set bits in its binary representation. Check whether a given number is sparse.

20.Given an array of size n-1 containing numbers from 1 to n with one missing, find the missing number using XOR.
